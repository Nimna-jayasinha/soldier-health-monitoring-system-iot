## üßπ ESP32 Pin Configuration

| Sensor / Module          | ESP32 Pin | Type           | Description                          |
|--------------------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Pulse Sensor             | GPIO32    | Analog Input   | Measures heart rate (BPM)            |
| LM35 Temperature Sensor  | GPIO34    | Analog Input   | Measures body temperature            |
| IR Sensor (Glove Check)  | GPIO35    | Analog Input   | Detects glove presence               |
| GPS RX (GPS TX ‚Üí ESP32) | GPIO16    | UART RX        | Receives GPS signal from module      |
| GPS TX (ESP32 TX ‚Üí GPS) | GPIO17    | UART TX        | Sends data to GPS module (if needed) |
| OLED SDA                 | GPIO21    | I2C Data       | Data line for OLED display           |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Power Tips

- Use a **7V LiPo battery** or a USB cable connected to your computer or a power bank.
- Ensure all sensors are rated for **3.3V** operation if powered from ESP32.
- Avoid using 5V sensors unless verified compatible with ESP32 logic levels.

## üîá Connection Best Practices

- Use **dupont jumper wires** or soldered connections for stable builds.
- Ensure **tight and clean connections** to avoid noise and sensor misreadings.
- Place the **pulse sensor** securely on the finger for accurate data.
- Keep analog signal wires **away from power wires** to reduce interference.

## üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Order (Suggested)

1. Connect the **Pulse Sensor** to GPIO32
2. Connect **LM35** to GPIO34
3. Connect **IR Sensor** to GPIO35
4. Connect **GPS module** to GPIO16 (RX) and GPIO17 (TX)
5. Wire **OLED Display** to GPIO21 (SDA) and GPIO22 (SCL)
6. Power all components from **3.3V** and **GND**
7. Upload the code and power up the device

## üß™ Testing Checklist

| Component        | Test                     |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Pulse Sensor     | Values between 60‚Äì100 BPM |
| LM35             | Temperature in ¬∞C        |
| IR Sensor        | Detects glove distance   |
| GPS              | Shows live Lat/Lng       |
| OLED             | Displays values clearly  |
